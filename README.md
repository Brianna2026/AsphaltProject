# AsphaltProject
My Unit 1 Computer Science Project.
 Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - In the neighborhood the AsphaltPainter creates an image of a butterfly with my methods. I made sure to work hard on creating this and hope that my thoughts would be clearly expressed in this piece.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - I am very proud of myself for being able to finish this project and creating the image I wanted perfectly.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - I would most likely try to add more complex methods to make the code look easier on eyes. I believe that if I had only this class I would be able to make a much better job of this.
